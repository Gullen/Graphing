===ORDER OF PROGRAMMING===

* Create middle axies line.
* Create axies coordinate lines.
* Create function to convert graph corrdinates to window coordinates.
* Create function to change number of lines.
* Link axies number to coordinate lines (to always fill the screen up) (essentially zooming in and out).
* Test drawing equations.
* Add ability to change sampling rate.
* Fix convert function to work with decimals.
* Allow to change number of lines for X and Y independantly.
* Added on screen textboxes to change X and Y range while running.
* Added on screen textboxes to change the color of the Graph.
* Created rule that if x-axies > 25, sampling rate = 1  else, sampling rate = 0.1
* Added an catch function if try to make axies number 0. (Otherwise will be div by 0).
